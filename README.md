# Kent-MCS-Project

## Global

In this repository you will find the work produced for the master's project.

You will find only the code and the results produced as well as some sources which helped me in the design of the project.

## Code

In the src folder you'll find all the code produced in: python, julia final, I haven't saved any unfinished or unused work.

The different codes are used can be found in .ipynb to be used in google colab if for different resont, the system hydra has probm√®me of copatibiliter.

## Results

The results have been compared although no conclusions will be drawn here. You can find the results in the json folder and the results of the comparison in the image folder.

## Launch

To facilitate the launch of all this, a script is provided, it is intended to be used in the Hydra environment (using among other Slurm functionality) but can be used locally, at least for code not using a GPU.

```bash
./launch.sh --help
```
